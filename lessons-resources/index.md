Web-based maps
--------------

### Tilemill 

- The [Tilemill Crashcourse](http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/crashcourse/introduction/) is a really nice introduction to Tilemill and the basics of web maps.
- When you've finished that, the [Tilemill documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/add-shapefile/) contains some excellent guides for more advanced usage.

### Leaflet
	
- The [Leaflet examples page](http://leafletjs.com/examples.html) is very good; if you're looking to try your hand with Leaflet, it's a great place to start.
	
### D3
	
- [Scott Murray's D3 Tutorials](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3).
- An expanded version of this tutorial can be found in his book [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345).
- Mike Bostock (creator of D3) has collected [a list of D3 tutorials](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Tutorials), many written by him. They include links to talks and video examples. 

### Google Fusion Tables

- Our own Alan McConchie has a great guide [here](http://mappingmashups.net/2012/11/29/mapping-with-google-fusion-tables)
	
### OpenStreetMap

- [Beginners Guide to OSM](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners'_guide)
- [LearnOSM.com](http://learnosm.org/en)
- [iD, a modern in-browser map editor for OSM](http://www.mapbox.com/blog/new-map-editor-launches-openstreetmap/)
- [Editing OSM with Tilemill and iD and satellite imagery](http://www.mapbox.com/blog/tracing-landsat8-for-osm/)

Traditional mapping
-------------------

### Quantum GIS (QGIS)

- [Great tutorial by Lex Berman at Harvard](http://maps.cga.harvard.edu/qgis/). It's less of a tutorial than an entire website built to walk someone through QGIS, beginning with installation. If you've used QGIS before, or are familiar with the interface, you can start where you need to. Many sections include video.
- [A Very Short Introduction to QGIS by Alan McConchie](http://mappingmashups.net/2012/11/30/a-very-short-introduction-to-qgis/)


Process-oriented articles
-------------------------

- [Mapping Chicago's Shooting Victims](http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2013/07/15/mapping-chicagos-shooting-victims). Uses Leaflet.js, Stamen base tiles, OSM, and Django.
- [Mapping Millions of Dots by Eric Fischer](http://www.mapbox.com/blog/mapping-millions-of-dots/)
