#Code of Conduct

Maptime is place of learning and fun. A primary goal of Maptime is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity and race, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

The folks down at HQ have compiled a set of expectations for our community. At our Vancouver chapter we intend to follow these expectations unless we as a community decide to define our own ground rules.

The full code can be found [here](http://maptime.io/code-of-conduct/). Please read through and have a think about how you can make Maptime a positive space for everyone.
