Join us Tuesday March 17th for the next MaptimeYVR! [Joey](http://jk-lee.com/) will be teaching us some of the (many) things he knows about the inner workings of [Tilemill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). We will be walking away with some good-looking maps at the end!

Joey (and the City) will provide the data, but before you arrive, install Tilemill on your machine, so we can get right to it.

Our events wouldnâ€™t be possible without the generous Liam Whalen and the rest of [BC Libraries Coop](https://www.bc.libraries.coop). Thank you!

Bring your laptop, and as always, beginners are very welcome.

*When* 6.00 - 8.00 March 17th

*Where*  BC Libraries Coop, 605 Robson Street, Suite 850,

If you for some inexplicable reason are late for the most fun meetup of the week, and find yourself locked out, let us know, at maptimeyvr@gmail.com and we will come down and get you.
