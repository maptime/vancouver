Join us Tuesday March 3rd for the next MaptimeYVR! It’s project night, which means you get to bring whatever mapstuff you’re working on, hack it, flaunt it, shake it and make it with the nice vibes that flow in the maptime space (generously hosted by the [BC Libraries Coop](https://www.bc.libraries.coop)!)

Amr will start off with a minitutorial on how github and maps go together, and then we are on our own, together!

Bring your laptop, and as always, beginners are very welcome.

One of our members will be downstairs to let everyone in, until 6.15, so do try to make it by then! Contact us at maptimeyvr@gmail.com if you're outside after this.
