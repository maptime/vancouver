So many good things happend at this week’s maptime! 

[Joey](https://twitter.com/leejoeyk) gave us a stellar tour of tilemill and mapbox, and for those of you who missed it (where were you?!), check out Joey’s [Hello Webmaps tutorial on GitHub](https://github.com/joeyklee/hellowebmaps). We mapped some of the seedy stuff that went down in Vancouver in 2013, and you can see how good it looks (visually, not morally)! Thanks Joey.

[CartoDB](http://maptime.io/blog/2015/03/03/Maptime-March-Madness-Great-Big-CartoDB-Donation/), out of the generousity of their mapping hearts, sponsored us with cheesy pizza so we had enough power to run all the brains in the room

And as if that weren’t enough, there were brand new stickers, brought to us by [Alan](https://twitter.com/mappingmashups) from the [Maptime HQ](http://maptime.io/) (who also upped our twitter game - we might just have been trending for a while there)! 

Again, thanks to the [BC Libraries Cooperative](https://bc.libraries.coop) for providing space, wifi and power - you guys rock!

Our next meeting will be a project night, on Tuesday March 31st. Stay tuned for more info!
