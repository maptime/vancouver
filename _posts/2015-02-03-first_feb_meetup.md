Thanks to all of you who came out and shared ideas and got the ball rolling on our very special, secret, super cool #MaptimeYVR project.... 

We sadly learned that some of you arrived after we had started our session, and were met with a locked door and no number to call :( We will definitely avoid those SNAFUs in the future, with more and better contact info. 

Our next meetup is on February 17th. [@Amr](https://twitter.com/AmrEldib) will be teaching us what we need to know about [GitHub](http://github.com/) and how we can use it in our mapmaking (Thanks Amr)! More details to follow.

If you have questions, tweet us [@maptimeYVR](https://twitter.com/maptimeYVR)
