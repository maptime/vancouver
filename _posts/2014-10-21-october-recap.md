Were you at the October Meetup? If you were, then you know we had a great session. If you weren't, you missed a great event. 

[Alan McConchie](http://stamen.com/studio/alan) of Stamen Design and [Maptime SF](http://maptime.io) stopped by to meet us and gave a workshop on the [Anatomy of a Web Map](http://maptime.io/anatomy-of-a-web-map/#0). It was a lot of information to swallow, but the best way to learn how to make a web map is to jump in and build one ([this tutorial from Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start.html) is a great place to start). If you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript, it'll be easy. If you don't, come to the next MaptimeYVR meetup and we'll be happy to help you get started.

A lot of new people showed up, which was great! There was a range of experience and interests, from hardcore GISers to people who are only starting out with maps. We even had someone who was interested in attaching cameras to balloons and kites to collect mapping data, and one person who is working with the [BC Cycling Coalition](http://www.bccc.bc.ca) to map all the bicycle touring routes across the province. 

We're just getting started in Vancouver, but MaptimeYVR works best when we all pitch in. Our November meetup will be an open hack night. Bring your questions, project ideas you want to workshop, and any knowldedge you want to share with the rest of the happy map geeks. See you in November!
