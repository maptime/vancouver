If you attended this weekend's [Code4Lib BC Unconference](http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/BC) and are looking for more mapping/dataviz/geocoding goodness, why not come to the next MaptimeYVR meeting? 
Maptime wants to open the doors of mapmaking to everyone. Our meetings are social, open to everyone regardless of technical ability, and are only missing one thing -- **you**!

We're taking a bit of a winter break, but we'll resume meetings in January. Follow[MaptimeYVR](http://twitter.com/maptimeyvr) on Twitter, or [join our Meetup group] to stay up to date on our local activities.  We're always looking for folks who are willing to lead workshops, too!
