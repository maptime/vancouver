We know we’ve been quiet, but that ends now! **Maptime Vancouver is back** on track, with some exciting new changes. First of all, we are happy to announce that [Joey Lee](https://twitter.com/leejoeyk) is joining our organizing team, bringing plenty of mapping experience, fresh ideas and a patent smile to the mix.

We’ve also **changed locations**: Maptime will now take place in Railtown, in an office space generously opened to us by Mark at [Konkurito](http://www.konkurito.com/). Thanks Mark!

While we’ve been lazying around, we’ve noticed that you’ve been doing quite the opposite. You’ve been patient, and for that we are grateful. Our group has grown, and there are now 177 Maplovers in our group. That’s exciting!

To bring you light in the fall, we plan to kick off the #MaptimeYVR season with:

1. What is Maptime? 
2. What skills can we share? / What projects can we make?
3. Walk away with your first web map! 


Throughout the coming weeks we will post our schedule for the next little while, so stay tuned for more meetups!

As always, beginners are very welcome at Maptime, and we will always take the time to answer your questions. Remember your laptop, and prepare for some mapping fun!

**When** 6.00 - 8.00 Wednesday November 25th

**Where** Konkurito offices, 343 Railway Street, office 301. Ring the buzzer, and we will let you in.
