Thanks to all of you who made it out for this weekâ€™s Maptime. What a great turnout it was! Many thanks to the [BC Libraries Cooperative](https://bc.libraries.coop) for loaning us the space - we literally couldn't do this without them.

[@amr](http://www.twitter.com/amreldib) told us ALL the things about GitHub, and we left the room, brains brimming with ideas about all the cool things we can do. Amr is, in true Maptime/GitHub spirit, generously sharing his slides over on his [site](http://www.amreldib.com/slides/introToGitHub/#/) if you want to have another look. Thanks!

Our next meeting will be a project night, on Tuesday March 3rd. Stay tuned for more info!

Maptime is for everyone regardless of background, technical skill. Maptime is for **you**! We welcome anyone wanting to share, learn, and teach anything related to cartography.
