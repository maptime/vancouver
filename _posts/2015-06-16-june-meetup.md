MaptimeYVR is delighted to announce our next meetup event two weeks from now. In what will be a change of pace from the usual meetups, MaptimeYVR will have a collaboration with the City of Vancouver Archives to learn more about the Archives’ work in preserving the City’s open data (and, in particular) geodata.

There will be a presentation detailing the Archives’ preservation work, extensive historic map collection (including the recently digitized and publicly viewable Goad’s fire insurance map, the digitization program, as well as a discussion of future dream projects.

Following the presentation there will be time for questions and discussion as well as opportunities to view the historic maps available in the Reading Room.

There will be some light refreshments and a chance to mingle at the start while everyone has a chance to find the venue.

Please note the venue as this event will be hosted by the City of Vancouver Archives (1150 Chestnut St by Vanier Park in Kitsilano).

This is a FREE community event open to everybody, and as space is limited we ask that interested attendees confirm their attendance as soon as possible by registering for a ticket.

A huge thank you goes out to Sue Bigelow at the City of Vancouver Archives and everybody else at the Archives for spearheading this idea and making this event possible.
