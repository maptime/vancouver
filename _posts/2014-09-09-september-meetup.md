We have a date! We have space!

**Date** - Tuesday, September 9, 2014

**Time** - 6:30 - 8:00pm

**Location** - BC Libraries Cooperative, 605 Robson Street, Suite 850

Help us get [@maptimeVAN](http://twitter.com/maptimevan) off to a great start! The agenda is up to you, but I thought it would be good to start off with some basic info: how often do we want to meet (weekly or monthly), intros, and an overview of all the fun geo/mappy stuff happening in Vancouver. If there’s time, I (Cecily) will do a presentation on OpenStreetMap 101.

Where we’ll go next is up to you! If you have questions, contact [@skeskali](http://twitter.com/skeskali) or [@maptimeVAN](http://twitter.com/maptimevan) on Twitter.
