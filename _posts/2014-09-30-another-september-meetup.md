[@maptimeYVR](http://twitter.com/maptimeyvr) is off to a great start, but it'll be even better with you there! We're still getting a feel for what we want the group to be, and your input is a very important part of this process.  Also, you won't want to miss our Intro to Github workshop, which will include information on how you can publish static websites with Github Pages!

Where weâ€™ll go next is up to you! If you have questions, contact  [@maptimeYVR](http://twitter.com/maptimevan) on Twitter. or via email <maptimeyvr@gmail.com>
