Looking for other mapmaking goodness? OpenStreetMap Vancouver is throwing a [Mapping What You Know Party](http://www.meetup.com/OpenStreetMap-Vancouver/events/218377932/) on *Tuesday, 25 November* at the Community Living Society in New Westminster. The party will focus on using the iD editor map to map locations where you live, work and play, such as supermarkets and pubs. No experience is necessary, but you should plan on bringing your own laptop.

The Community Living Society is located at [713 Columbia Street](http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/83664814) in New West. Transit access is excellent, as the New West SkyTrain station is only a block away. Reasonably priced parking is also available nearby.
