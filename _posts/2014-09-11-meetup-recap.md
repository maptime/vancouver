title: First MaptimeYVR Meetup A Success
author: Cecily
---

It was great to hang out with a group of map lovers this week! Many thanks to the [BC Libraries Cooperative](https://bc.libraries.coop) for loaning us the space for the next 10 weeks - we literally couldn't do this without them.

We hammered out a few details about how the group would run:

- We're going to meet every 3-4 weeks to start; weekly meetings as needed
- We'll start by having a few workshops on how to use mapping tools, Github, and other resources
- We talked about alternate locations
  - Along the Broadway corridor?
  - Meeting at a pub or restaurant?
  - Alternate day of the week?

For now, we're going to stick with the BC Libraries Coop office on Tuesday nights. If there's a change, we'll note it here.

Maptime is for everyone regardless of background, technical skill. Maptime is for **you**! We welcome anyone wanting to share, learn, and teach anything related to cartography. We'd love to see your face at our next meetup, **Tuesday, September 30 at 6:30 pm**. Space is limited to 15 seats, so be sure to [register](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/maptimeyvr-meetup-tickets-13063018841) to save your spot.
