Come on over to our next Project Night, for some mapping, hacking, chatting and freestyle learning. Bring your own projects and connect to the hivemind to see what others are working on.

If you donâ€™t have a project of your own, but still want to learn and do maps, we will also be continuing our shared project making a How-to for crowdsourced mapdata. Sound interesting? Join us, and we will tell you all about it!

Or, if you have no idea about anything of what was just mentioned, but you're still curious about Maptime, come and bring all your questions! 

Bring your laptop, and as always, beginners are very welcome.

*When* 6.00 - 8.00 March 31st

*Where*  BC Libraries Coop, 605 Robson Street, Suite 850,

Arrive before 6, and the doors will be open, and the elevator takes you to the 8th floor, no questions asked. If you're late and find yourself locked out, let us know, at maptimeyvr@gmail.com and we will come down and get you. 

Thanks again to Liam Whalen and the rest of [BC Libraries Coop](https://www.bc.libraries.coop). You are the basemap to our polygons - we couldnt project without you.
