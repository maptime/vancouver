[Alan McConchie](http://stamen.com/studio/alan) of Stamen Design and [#MaptimeSF](http://www.maptime.io) will be in our fair city on October 21! How cool is that?

Alan will give a talk on the Anatomy of a Web Map, and will be on hand to answer any questions you have on all things mapping.

We'll meet on Tuesday, October 21 the BC Libraries Cooperative, 605 Robson Street, Suite 850. The meeting will start at 6:30 pm and go until about 8pm. [Registration is free](http://maptime.github.io/vancouver/event/2014/10/21/october-meetup/), but seats are limited. 

You don't want to miss this event. See you there!
