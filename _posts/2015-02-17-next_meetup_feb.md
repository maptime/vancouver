Ever wondered what this thing called GitHub is and why webmappers are all about it? Scratched your head and thought ‘how the fork do I make a repo’? Wanna branch out and commit to a new issue? Are you thinking those last sentences sound like gibberish? You won’t after you’ve come to our next Maptime meetup!

GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on projects. You don’t have to worry about losing data on your hard drive or managing a project across multiple computers — sync from anywhere. Most importantly, GitHub is a collaborative and asynchronous workflow for building software better, together.

Our next meetup is on Tuesday February 17th. Maptimer [@Amr](https://twitter.com/AmrEldib) is teaching us what we need to know about [GitHub](http://github.com/) and how we can use it in our mapmaking (Thanks Amr)! 

Before you arrive, make a [GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) (the free version is good enough for us) and install it (google "download github for *your OS*") on your machine, so that you’re ready to go.

Remember to bring your own computer, and as always, beginners are very welcome!

**what** - GitHub Intro

**where** - BC Libraries Cooperative, 605 Robson Street, Suite 850
